"# Advanced_tictactoe" 
We were asked by the teacher to create a normal tictactoe for a project but we can also go above and beyound by adding more features to the game if we want. The students who do that will get more marks. I decided to do that and i add some features to the game that shows the statistics of each player and a feature where a single player can play with the computer.
